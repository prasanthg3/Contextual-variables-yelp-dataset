check the significace of contextual variables in prediction\
While performing the prediction of any ratings for a business, we usually consider the variables which directly effect the outcome. I am interested in finding whether the contextual variables play a significant role in better predicting the ratings\
# Data
I chose the dataset from the yelp reviews which has information about business, user,rating, reviews\
# Analysis
Import the data set\
Identify possible contextual variables\
extract and clean the reviews text from data set\
generate a data frame by computing scores of each review with all context variables\
split the data frame into test and train data set\
compute average rating for both test and train data\
select the required features and run regression\
compute RMSE of different regressions with and without context variables\
verify the significance\
# Outcome
Check whether contextual variables aid in better predicting the ratings\
